    <h1>History of Earth</h1>
    <P>The history of Earth covers approximately 4 billion years (4,567,000,000 years), from Earth’s formation out of the solar nebula to the present. This article presents a broad overview, summarizing the leading scientific theories. Due to the difficulty of comprehending very large amounts of time, the analogy of a single 24-hour period will be used, beginning exactly 4.567 billion years ago, at the formation of Earth, and ending now. Each second of this period represents approximately 53,000 years (or 53 millennia). The Big Bang and origin of the universe, estimated at occurring 13.7 billion years ago, is equivalent to taking place almost three days ago—two whole days before our clock began to tick.</P>

    <h1>Origin</h1>
    <p>Earth formed as part of the birth of the solar system: what eventually became the solar system initially existed as a large, rotating cloud of dust and gas. It was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements produced by stars long gone. Then, about 4.6 billion years ago (fifteen to thirty minutes before our imaginary clock started), a nearby star probably became a supernova. The explosion sent a shock wave toward the solar nebula and caused it to contract. As the cloud continued to rotate, gravity and inertia flattened the cloud into a proto- planetary disc, perpendicular to its axis of rotation. Most of the mass concentrated in the middle and began to heat up. The impossibility of kinetic heat, produced by the infall of matter escaping caused the centre to heat up sufficiently to enable the centre of the concentration to produce its own internal heat source through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, starting as a T Tauri star, our early sun. Meanwhile, as gravity caused matter to condense around dust particles, the rest of the disc started to break up into rings. Small fragments collided and became larger fragments. These included one collection approximately 150 million kilometers from the centre: Earth. As the Sun condensed and heated, fusion began, and the resulting T Tauri solar wind cleared out most of the material in the disc that had not already condensed into larger bodies.</p>

    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <p>The origin of the Moon is still uncertain, although much evidence exists for the giant impact hypothesis. Earth may not have been the only planet forming 150 million kilometers from the Sun. It is hypothesized that another collection occurred 150 million kilometers from both the Sun and the Earth, at the fourth or fifth Lagrangian point. This planet, named Theia, is thought to have been smaller than the current Earth, probably about the size and mass of Mars. Its orbit may at first have been stable but destabilized as Earth increased its mass by the accretion of more and more material. Theia swung back and forth relative to Earth until, finally, an estimated 4.533 billion years ago (perhaps 12:05 a.m. on our clock), it collided at a low, oblique angle. The low speed and angle were not enough to destroy Earth, but a large portion of its crust was ejected. Heavier elements from Theia sank to Earth’s core, while the remaining material and ejecta condensed into a single body within a couple of weeks. Under the influence of its own gravity, this became a more spherical body: the Moon. The impact is also thought to have changed Earth’s axis to produce the large 23.5° axial tilt that is responsible for Earth’s seasons. (A simple, ideal model of the planets’ origins would have axial tilts of 0° with no recognizable seasons.) It may also have sped up Earth’s rotation and initiated the planet’s plate tectonics.</p>
